# Additions to you .bashrc for short Emacs commands line
#
# Add the following alias to your .bashrc
#
#  - ee: starts Emacs in terminal mode.
#        NOTE: unless your terminal implements ANSI code sequences
#              for the cursor keys and the function keys you won't be able
#              to use PEL main key prefixes.
#
#  - e:   start Emacs in graphical mode.
#         Use the bash executable script graphics-emacs.sh stored in the
#         ~/bin directory.
#         Copy the pel/example/bin/graphics-emacs.sh in a ~/bin directory,
#         make the file executable (chmod +x) and use the following alias.
#         This way you do not have to add ~/bin to your PATH.

alias ee='emacs -nw'
alias e='~/bin/graphics-emacs.sh'
