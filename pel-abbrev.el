;;          http://endlessparentheses.com/ispell-and-abbrev-the-perfect-auto-correct.html
;;          The code is almost the same. I added and modified docstrings,
;;          modified names and argument and placed the code inside its own
;;          file.

;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides an extension to spell checking with ispell: the function
;; `pel-ispell-word-then-abbrev' corrects the spelling of the previous spell
;; checking error and adds a conversion in the abbrev table.  This way, when
;; the `abbrev-mode' is active these typos will be corrected automatically.

;; Note that it is possible to achieve the same functionality without the code
;; here if you use flyspell and customize the `flyspell-abbrev-p' use-option
;; to t and optionally set `flyspell-use-global-abbrev-table-p' to t.
