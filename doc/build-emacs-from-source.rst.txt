General Overview
================

:Ref: `What's new in Emacs 30.1?`_, by Mickey Petersen

This document describes how to build Emacs 30 on various platforms with
several useful features.  The build is done inside a specific directory,
located inside ``~/my/cdpub/emacs-repos``.

Step 1: Create a Git clone or Emacs repository
----------------------------------------------

::

  mkdir -p ~/my/dvpub/emacs-repos
  cd       ~/my/dvpub/emacs-repos
  git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

If you already had a copy of the repository, get the latest changes with::

  git pull


Step 2: Select the Git branch
-----------------------------

List the available tags and versions from the repository.

- To list the Git branches corresponding to recent Emacs development streams
  (like ``emacs-30`` for Emacs 30), you can use::

     git branch -r | sed -e s:origin/:: |  awk '{$1=$1; print}' | grep "^emacs"

- To list all Git tags::

    git tag


Select a tag or branch to check out.

Unless you have specific reasons to use a branch and want to use the very
latest code available, you probably want to build an existing release that has
gone through more testing.

- The tagged version correspond to the code at a specific moment, like a specific release.
  Something like ``emacs-30.1``.
- The branch may still be active and may correspond to the code as it evolves.
  For example, ``emacs-30`` is the branch for Emacs 30 development.
  After the release of Emacs 30.1,commits for the next Emacs 30 release are placed there.

============================== ===================================
Git Branch Name                Description
============================== ===================================
master                         Main.
emacs-30                       Branch. Evolution of Emacs 30.  Not stable.
emacs-30.1                     Tagged version.  Code that corresponds to release 30.1.
============================== ===================================

Step 3: Install Required Packages and Tools
-------------------------------------------

============================== =========================================
Name                           Description
============================== =========================================
Build Essentials               Build Essential tools;  ``sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"``
texinfo                        Texinfo package: ``dnf search texinfo``
gnutls                         GnuTLS support:  ``dnf search gnutls``
autoconf                       autoconf utility: ``dnf search autoconf``
libgccjit                      Required to enable Emacs native compiler
libjpeg-turbo-devel
libpng-devel
libtiff
============================== =========================================



Getting Help
============

====================== ==============================
Command                Purpose
====================== ==============================
``./configure --help`` List all configure options along with their purpose.
                       It's best to save the output of this command into a file
                       and read it carefully.

``make help``          List all make commands along with their purpose.
====================== ==============================



Build Emacs
===========

From the root of Emacs repository,
execute the following commands::

  ./autogen.sh
  make extraclean
  ./configure --without-x
  make

The ``--without-x`` is only required when building Emacs in
terminal mode only.  If you want graphical support do not use
this option.


To install the latest built emacs, execute::

  sudo make install

Confirming that Emacs Native Compilation is active
==================================================

- Start Emacs
- With PEL execute **pel-emacs-config-features**, bound to ``<f11> ? e C``.

  - If native compilation is active the message will show ``NATIVE_COMP``
    in the list and will confirm it with the following text: ``With native compilation.``

- Without PEL do the same as what PEL does in that function:

  .. code:: elisp


      (defun pel-emacs-config-features ()
        "Print the names of all Emacs configured compilation features."
        (interactive)
        (message "%s. With%s native compilation.%s" system-configuration-features
                 (if (and pel-emacs-28-or-later-p (featurep 'native-compile))
                     ""
                   "out")
