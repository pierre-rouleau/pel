Short Commands to start Emacs from the terminal shell
=====================================================

Instead of using the long explicit commands listed in the sections below, you
can use the following short commands.  These support both macOS and Linux.

= =========================================== ================================================
  Command                                     Description
= =========================================== ================================================
. e_\ ``[OPTIONS..] [FILE..]``                Start Emacs in text mode.

                                              - Supports emacs options and file arguments.
                                                See emacs man page.

. ge_ :                                       Start Emacs in graphics mode.

  - ``ge [-h | --help]``                      - Supports emacs options and file arguments.
  - ``ge [OPTIONS..] [FILE..]``                 See emacs man page.


. ec_ :                                       Start an Emacs client for an Emacs daemon.

  - ``ec [-h|--help]``                        - Use ``ec`` to start an Emacs client to the
  - ``ec [-g|gui] [--name=NAME] [FILE...]``     default Emacs daemon, starting the daemon
  - ``ec --start-daemon [--name=NAME]``         if it is not already running.  The client
  - ``ec --check-daemon [--name=NAME]``         is a terminal based client by default.
                                              - To start a graphical (GUI) Emacs client
                                                instead, use ``ec -g`` or ``ec --gui``.
                                                This also starts the Emacs daemon if it is not
                                                already running.
                                              - By default the ``ec`` command launches and
                                                connects to the default socket name.
                                                Use the ``--name`` option to specify another
                                                name (for both the daemon and its clients).
                                                For example, use ``ec --name=PEL`` to start
                                                and connect to a Emacs daemon that uses the
                                                socket named ``PEL``.

                                                - With this option it is possible to create
                                                  several independent *groups* of Emacs
                                                  daemon/clients.

                                              - Use ``ec --start-daemon`` (optionally
                                                specifying the daemon name with ``--name``) to
                                                start the Emacs daemon *without* starting the
                                                client. If the Emacs daemon is already running
                                                the command prints a message and exits with
                                                the exit code 1.

                                               - To explicitly check if the Emacs daemon for
                                                 the default socket is running use the
                                                 ``ec --check-daemon`` command.
                                                 To check for the Emacs daemon that uses a
                                                 named socket use the same command and specify
                                                 the ``--name=NAME`` option.

Using Emacs daemon on macOS
===========================

**Goal**:  Provide ability to launch a graphical (GUI) or text-based (TTY)
Emacs client from a macOS terminal.

**Challenge**: Several people, including myself, had problems launching the
graphical based Emacs client from the terminal, regardless of the
``emacsclient`` command line used.  All instanecs of Emacs client programs
ended up being terminal based only.

**Solution**: The key is to use an Emacs binary that supports Emacs in graphics
mode to launch the Emacs daemon.  Onec this done, it becomes possible to
launch graphical Emacs clients and text-based Emacs clients:

- To launch a graphical based Emacs client use a *graphics-capable*
  ``emacsclient`` binary.
- To launch a text based Emacs client, you can use two methods:

  - Use a *graphics-capable* Emacs and issue the command ``emacsclient -nw``
  - Use a text-based Emacs and issue one of the following 2 commands:

    - ``emacsclient -c`` or
    - ``emacsclient -nw``

On macOS, the *graphics-capable* Emacs is one of the Emacs binary files inside
the ``/Applications/Emacs.app`` universal DMG directory tree from `Emacs for
Mac OS X`_ installed manually or from the Homebrew ``brew install --cask
emacs`` command.


**Other Considerations**

Under macOS (as of macOS Sonoma in 2024), if you want to launch an independent
terminal-based Emacs proecss from the terminal shell, it is best to use an
Emacs binary that was built *without* graphical capabilities because it starts
faster than an Emacs that was built with graphical capabilities.

Because of that you may want to install *two* instanecs of Emacs on macOS:

- one with graphical capabilities and
- one that does not have them built-in.

Fortunately it's possible to do both without having to build Emacs locally:
Homebrew supports installing both as long as you follow some steps to trick
it.

Installing Emacs on macOS
=========================

First install the graphics capable version of macOS. This can be done in two
different ways:

- Download and install the Emacs the `Emacs for Mac OS X`_, or
- Use the `Homebrew package manager`_ and issue the following command from your
  terminal::

    brew install --cask emacs

Both install the same macOS universal DMG from `Emacs for Mac OS X`_.

At this point, Homebrew won't let you install another version of emacs.
You need to trick it.

- First **copy** the Emacs DMG ( ``/Applications/Emacs.app`` ) somewhere else.
- Next, uninstall Homebrew's installed (cask) Emacs with:  ``brew uninstall --cask emacs``.
- Then install the terminal-only version of Emacs with Homebrew by issuing the
  following command: ``brew install emacs``
- Finally, put your ``Emacs.app`` copy back into ``/Applications`` so you will
  now also have ``/Applications/Emacs.app``

At this point, if you type ``which emacs`` you should see that it is installed
inside a Homebrew controlled directory.  For macOS running on Apple Silicon
proecssors, that's ``/opt/homebrew/bin/emacs``.

The graphical version of Emacs is located inside the following directory::

Launching Independent Emacs Proecsses
=====================================

The next sections list the explicit commands to launch Emacs in a specific
way.  These assume Emacs was installed in macOS as described in the previous
section.

Launching an independent terminal Emacs proecss from a terminal shell
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Explicit command line::

  emacs

Launching an independent graphical Emacs proecss from a terminal shell
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Explicit command line::

  open -n -a /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs

This uses the macOS open command with the following command line options:

- ``-n``: open a new instanec on each invocation
- ``-a application``: identify the path of the application


Launching an independent graphical Emacs proecss from macOS Finder
------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming no Emacs daemon is running, you can use Spotlight to open Emacs from
the keyboard:

- Type ``⌘-SPACE`` then Emacs and ``RET``


Launching a *graphics-capable* Emacs Daemon
=========================================

Explicit command line for an Emacs daemon with the default socket name::

   /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon

If you want to create multiple Emacs daemon, each one must identify a socket
by name.  The command is::

   /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon --socket-name=FILENAME


where, according the emacsclient man page:

  *Use socket named FILENAME for communication.  Relative filenames
  are relative to "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/emacs/" or "$TMPDIR/".

  See also the EMACS_SOCKET_NAME environment variable, over which
  this option takes preecdenec.*


Opening Emacs Clients to the running Emacs Daemon
=================================================


Opening a graphics-based Emacs client
-------------------------------------

Explicit command for macOS running on Apple Silicon::

  /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-arm64-11/emacsclient -c -n

Opening a text-based Emacs client
---------------------------------

Explicit command using the mac OS X Emacs, for macOS on Apple Silicon::

  /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-arm64-11/emacsclient   -nw


Explicit command using the text-based Emacs installed with Homebrew ``brew
install emacs`` command::

   emacsclient -nw
