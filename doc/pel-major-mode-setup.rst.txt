Feature Overview
================

:See also: `Showing Information About Indentation and Hard Tab Control under PEL`_
:See also: `⅀ Help/Info PDF`_

PEL controls the installation of external package *and* the activation of
features, major and minor modes through customization.
This allows users to drive the way they use Emacs entirely via customization.

PEL users can have a customization for terminal-based Emacs and a different
one for graphical capable Emacs.

The default names of the two customization files are:

- ``~/emacs.d/emacs-customization.el``
- ``~/emacs.d/emacs-customization-graphics.el``

PEL provides a large number of customizable user-option varables, and defines
one user-option for each major mode it supports.  These all have the same name
format: ``pel-use-MM`` where ``MM`` is the name of the major mode, such as
``c``, ``cpp``, ``python``, ``rst``, etc...

PEL also provides a set of commands that provide extensive information about
the user-options controlling activation of PEL explicit support for a major
mode, the minor modes it supports for it, the various features, etc.

For several of the supported modes it provides a description on how some
features are controlled and which user-options is required for that.  For
example, it describes how indentation and hard-tab control is supported by the
major mode for several major modes.

The information is shown inside a help buffer; the user-options shown are
buttons that provide access to more information about the variable and to its
customization buffer where you can change the value for the Emacs session of
store the new value inside the customization file to make the selection
persistent.

PEL provides this information to help users setup the major modes they use.

Use one of the following commands to open these useful buffers:

- **pel-mode-setup-info** , bound to ``<f11> ? /`` globally and available
  inside buffers.  It can also be accessed by typing ``C-u <f11> ? ?``.
- The ``<f12> ?`` key sequence, available in major modes that PEL explicitly
  supports and have support for specialized information.  For those modes, typing
  ``<f12> ?`` ,  ``<f11> ? /`` or ``C-u <f11> ? ?`` does the same thing and
  opens up the specialized setup info buffer for the mode..


There are several aspects of the PEL configuration not yet supported by this
mechanism, and more will be developed.

The following screen shots show Emacs mode with the setup
information help buffer for some of the modes.  Since the information can be
printed in several lines, the window is split in two with the follow-mode
activated.

The command works for **all** major modes.   The major modes explicitly
supported by PEL show more information and the supported ones that have
a specialized command provide even more specialized information.

As time go, PEL will support mode major modes explicitly and will provide more
specialized setup information help for more modes.  It will also provide
information help on more topics.
