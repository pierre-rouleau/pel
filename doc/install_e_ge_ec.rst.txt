Use this method to quickly install the e_, ge_ and ce_ scripts described in
`Using the Emacs daemon and clients`_
into your Unix compliant system.


- Open a sh-compliant shell (Bash or zsh for example).
- Execute the `pel/bin/setup/install-scripts.sh`_ script specifying its relative
  or absolute path.

  - This will create symbolic links inside your ``~/bin`` directory
    that points to the e, ge and ce scripts located in the ``pel/bin``
    directory.
  - It will check if the ``~/bin`` directory exists, if everything is OK to
    proceed and will report an error otherwise.
  - If all is OK, it will install the symbolic links inside ``~/bin`` and will
    check if the directory is in your PATH.  If it's not it will remind you to
    add it.

Here's a sample of a successful execution, where pel is installed in ``~/my/dv/elisp``:

.. code:: sh

        > 0,et:14ms,L2,roup@newcray@07:59:07[~]
        bash$ ~/my/dv/elisp/pel/bin/setup/install-scripts.sh
        SUCCESS!!
        Installation of e, ge and ec scripts completed!
        They are:

        lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  33 29 May 07:59 /Users/roup/bin/e -> /Users/roup/my/dv/elisp/pel/bin/e
        lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  34 29 May 07:59 /Users/roup/bin/ge -> /Users/roup/my/dv/elisp/pel/bin/ge
        lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  34 29 May 07:59 /Users/roup/bin/ec -> /Users/roup/my/dv/elisp/pel/bin/ec

        For help on these commands use their --help command line option.
           e --help is emacs --help.
           e opens an independent emacs process in terminal mode.
           eg and ec have their own help, which are:

        ge : Open an independent, detached, graphical-mode instance of Emacs.

         Usage: ge [-h|--help]
                ge [FILE..]

         Note: All command line arguments are passed to the Emacs application
               unchanged.  See Emacs man page for more options.

               Emacs is launched inside an independent OS window, but
               that process inherit the current directory.
               Control is returned right away to the terminal shell.


        ec : Open specified files in emacsclient. Start Emacs daemon if necessary.

         Usage:  ec [-h|--help]
                 ec [-g|--gui] [--name=FILENAME]
                 ec --check-daemon [--name=FILENAME]
                 ec --start-daemon [--name=FILENAME]

         -h, --help: print this help.
         -g, --gui:  start a graphical emacsclient, otherwise
                     start a terminal-based emacsclient (the default).

         If the Emacs daemon is not already running, start it.

         If the --name option is specified, FILENAME identifies the
         socket name the daemon and the client must use.
         It's possible to create several daemons and client(s)
         attaching to that daemon by using that option.

         Use ec --start-daemon to only start the daemon without starting any client.
         If the daemon is already running the command prints a message and exit with
         an exit code of 1.  It can be used to check if the daemon is running.

         See emacsclient man page for more command line options.

         Note: under macOS, to be able to launch an Emacs client that is a GUI Emacs
               the GUI supporting Emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/
               must be installed.
