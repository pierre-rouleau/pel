Overview
========


PEL simplifies the steps to create an executable script that has no file
extension.  Follow these steps to open a extension-less file, create the
shebang line, add a file header and save the file.

PEL binds the ``<f12>`` key to the **pel-as** command (and optionally its
alias, the **as** command).  It also supports a major-mode specific key map
that uses the ``<f12>`` key prefix and a ``<f12><f12>`` sub-prefix to control
access to the commands used to insert PEL tempo skeleton and to access the
various customizable user-options that have an impact on the format of the
generated templates.

The ``<f12>`` key binding to **pel-as** is available globally for any buffer
in fundamental-mode and for major modes not supported by PEL (or when that
support has not yet been activated by the setting of the major-mode specific
``pel-use-....`` user-option).

The **pel-as** command prompts the user for one of the supported major modes,
such as bash, zsh, perl, pike, python, etc...

Once selected **pel-as** writes the appropriate shebang line at the top of the
buffer and make the corresponding file executable.  It also sets the
major-mode of the buffer to the one selected.

From that moment, the ``<f12>`` key becomes a key prefix to the PEL major-mode
specific key-map.  Inside that key-map there's another key prefix
``<f12><f12>`` that provides access to the PEL tempo skeleton commands.  These
commands are either specialized or generic code templates.

For example, the ``<f12><f12> h`` key sequence inserts a file header that
corresponds to what's needed for this type of file, with the comment properly
written and several fields automatically filled and others the user should
complete.

The ``<f12><f12><f2>`` key sequence opens the customization buffer where you
can modify various user-options that control various aspects of the templates.

The key sequences are the same in all supported major-modes.

For this to work, however, you **must** activate PEL extra support for the
major mode by setting the corresponding **pel-use-...** user-option.  For
example, to support creating Pike executable scripts with this method, you
must set the **pel-use-pike** user option to ``t``.
