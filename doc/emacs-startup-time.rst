Background
==========

Speeding up Emacs startup is a controversial topic in the Emacs development
community. The reasons are varied but are often rooted to the facilities
provided by Emacs to work-around a slow Emacs startup.  These include:

- using Emacs as a daemon
- building an Emacs image with a large amount of often used packages,
- Emacs 27 and later package-quickstart mechanism.


Although these facilities are really helping and do provide the ability to
start editing files very quickly, they appeal to a set of use case scenarios,
but not all of them.

I often use multiple instances of Emacs for doing various, unrelated tasks and
want to keep each one a single entity with its own history and context.  I
also want to develop Emacs Lisp code and try it inside on or several Emacs
instances without affecting some already running Emacs sessions.  Because of
that I end up launching Emacs sessions relatively often, at least the ones
that are short-lived. And I want my Emacs sessions to start quickly, ideally
under 300 milliseconds.

Also, Emacs itself is improving.  The gccemacs_ implementation speed it up even
further.  But even with all of the existing techniques when a user has a large
number of Emacs package managed with the Emacs built-in package manager,
package.el, Emacs startup can slow down noticeably.

I started writing PEL as the mechanism I use to control what package I use and
allow me to quickly deactivate some of them.  PEL uses Emacs customization
mechanism and with that I can create several customization files, each one
specific to a given type of development or workflow.  I have managed to keep
my Emacs startup relative fast, despite the large number of packages that I
have downloaded, which is over 250.

But still, I'd like to see my Emacs start as quickly as other editors.  It
bugs me. I like Emacs.  I have invested time in learning Emacs. I know there
are much more to learn and I will continue this learning for a long time.  And
want to have a snappy startup for what I use every day, every hour.

I will write my ideas in this document as I go about trying to make my copy of
Emacs start as fast as possible while using a large number of packages.

Current Status
==============

Currently PEL uses:

- the built-in package manager, package.el,
- the built-in Emacs customization system,
- the Emacs Elpa directory where all packages installed by package.el are
  stored, each one into its own directory,
- a separate directory, the PEL Utils directory (normally in
  ``~/.emacs.d/utils``) that stores Emacs Lisp files that are not Elpa
  packages
- **pel-init** that controls installation and checks what must be activated as
  requested by the set of ``pel-use-`` user-options,

  - the PEL installation and activation logic attempts to delay activation as
    late as possible to ensure that the user pays in time for a feature only
    when that feature is first required.

- **pel-cleanup** that removes what is currently not used but installed.


I originally started measuring the startup with the benchmark-init package. As
I write this, in a remote access terminal-based session to Emacs 26.3 running
inside a 2014 macOS machine running a 4GHz Intel Core i7, benchmark-init is
reporting a 0.5 second Emacs startup time.
The benchmark-init system reports the following::

There's 240 lines in this report. I removed several showing the loads from the
elpa directories that report as 0 millisecond.

On Emacs 27, the report is shorter and Emacs starts a little faster with the
package-quickstart activated.

The benchmark-init and make timeit
----------------------------------

Recently I added a ``timeit`` rule in PEL Makefile. This measures the time it
takes to start and stop Emacs.  This provides a better measurement of the
time, but without providing the insight available in benchmark-init report.
As the report show, benchmark-init itself takes time.

Currently, the ``make timeit`` report, on the same machine and environment,
for the 0.5 second reported by benchmark-init I get the following reports::

The computer is running lots of other applications and processes at the same
time.  The time measurement is therefore not very precise, but it gives an
indication.  Two consecutive ``make timeit`` runs report a time of 1.67 and
1.77 seconds respectively of which about two third is spent in user space and
one third in kernel space.

Could that be reduced?

I disabled the following lines in my init.el file that activate the benchmark-init:

.. code:: lisp

  (require 'benchmark-init
           (expand-file-name
            "~/.emacs.d/elpa/benchmark-init-20150905.938/benchmark-init"))
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'benchmark-init/deactivate)


And then, running ``make timeit`` again, I get a little faster startup of
about 1.65 second::

Experiment - Adding a directory with symlinks to files
------------------------------------------------------

As a next step for trying to reduce the startup time, I removed the
benchmark-init directory located in
``~/.emacs.d/elpa/benchmark-init-20150905.938/benchmark-init`` and then added
another one, ``~/.emacs.d/elpa-copy-link`` to the front of load-path with the
following Emacs Lisp line placed inside my init.el file:

.. code:: lisp

  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elpa-copy-link"))

Now, the ``make timeit`` test produces a little faster startup of about 1.53 seconds::

I suspect the startup to be faster because the package.el initialization has
to parse all directories inside the ``~/.emacs.d/elpa`` directory.  With a
smaller number of directories or with one that provides symlinks to a lot of
Emacs Lisp files from a large number of packages, the search is faster.


Experiment - Disabling package.el
---------------------------------

Next I disabled setup and initialization of package.el altogether.
Because PEL depends on package.el to check for package presence and to install
requested but missing Elpa packages, I also had to disabled the
**pel-elpa-pkg-dependencies** and the **pel-package-installed-p**.  They
return hard-coded values that identify no dependencies and that the feature is
installed respectively, circumventing PEL logic that tries to manage
installation of missing packages.

The load-path holds the "~/.emacs.d/elpa-copy-link" directory at the beginning
of the list.  That directory contains symlinks to all Emacs Lisp files that
come from packages that have no sub-directories. For me, at this point,
that's 182 packages.  The directories **are still inside the
``~/.emacs.d/elpa`` directory** though.


With these changes, PEL driven Emacs is not able to install anything and
**pel-cleanup** does not work properly, but Emacs and its installed packages
is fully functional (although I can't request the installation of anything
that's not already installed.)

The impact on Emacs startup is negligible, and not significant, it's even a
little slower (so the difference is probably not significant) ::

Experiment - Disabling package.el and removing elpa directories
---------------------------------------------------------------

Keeping the same setup as the previous experiment I removed all directories of
``~/.emacs.d/elpa`` that contain no sub-directories and whose files are
identified by symlinks stored inside the ``~/.emacs.d/elpa-copy-link`` which
is in the load-path.

I tried that and Emacs **fails**!  Hum...

Now instead of of using symlinks inside the ``~/.emacs.d/elpa-copy-link``
directory I store a **copy** of the Emacs Lisp and their byte-compiled files
inside ``~/.emacs.d/elpa-copy-link``.

Now Emacs runs file and the speedup is
considerable: the `make timeit`` test shows 0.64 second instead of over 1.7
seconds!  That shaved about 1 full second out of the process!!

Also the **emacs-init-time** command now returns 0.2 second!!

But wait....  The auto-loading was not done and packages that depend on it
do not work.

So the next step is to find a way to process the auto-loading of these files.
Instead of leaving all of the auto-loading files the way they are, since a
mechanism needs to be set in place to have the files located somewhere else,
I'll see if I can write something that will process all auto-loading files and
create a shorter piece of code that will run faster. I would probably
eliminate the auto-loading of docstrings to speed things up a little more.


Hopefully the resulting code will not take much time and we can keep the same
type of execution speed as what is shown above.

..

   So with this setup, with Emacs able to access 192 packages (167 + 25) with 27
   Elpa packages stored in their original directories (these are the ones that
   have sub-directories) and 30 Emacs Lisp files stored in PEL Utils, I am
   getting Emacs 26.3 to start in 0.2 seconds!!  And this is **without using
   use-package** (even though PEL uses the same general techniques).

   In the `use-package introduction`_, John Wiegley writes:

    "*I created it because I have over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things
    were getting difficult to manage. Yet with this utility my total load time is
    around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!*"

   Now, with no loss of Emacs functionality, but with loss of PEL's ability to
   install software, I end up with a system that uses 192 external packages and
   starts in 0.2 second.  That's **24 times faster**! On Emacs 26.3.

   And If I use Emacs 27 or later, use gccemacs and use Emacs in daemon mode
   I'll benefit for these speedup as well.

   Notice also that for some reason I don't yet understand, using symlinks did
   not work.  That needs to be investigated.

..

   What's Next?
   ============

   I need to learn package.el and Emacs startup mechanism to understand why it's
   much faster to use a smaller number of elpa sub-directories, why symlinks did
   not fail and how I can make PEL be able to support automatic detection and
   installation while starting real fast as it did in the last step of the
   experiment.   I also need to understand how to handle Emacs Lisp packages that
   have sub-directories and see if I can find a way to put all files inside a
   single directory that ideally would contain symlinks to the real location of
   the Emacs Lisp files.  This way I could design something that uses an existing
   package manager like package.el or also perhaps something like Borg or
   straight and provide a layer on top in a form of a single directory with
   symlinks to everything.  And while I'm at it why not also do this for all
   files in Utils and for the native Emacs Lisp packages and end up with **only
   one** directory in my load-path.  That should speed things up even more.

   I always wondered why we use a large number of directories in the Emacs
   load-path. I understand that its good to keep un-related files inside their
   own, separate, directories.  That's a requirement for several things,
   including DVCS like Git.  But why not use a *small* number of directories in
   the load-path which contain symlinks to the location to real files?  We do
   that on Unix-like OS all the time.

   On the system where this was tested, the following directories are in PATH,
   The number before identifies the number of files.  Most of them are symlinks::

    1518 files: /usr/local/bin
     969 files: /usr/bin
      35 files: /bin
     235 files: /usr/sbin
      62 files: /sbin
     127 files: /opt/X11/bin
       7 files: /usr/local/sbin

   That is 2953 files.  Could you imagine having 1000 entries in your PATH?  Or
   even 100?

   Having one directory per OS-level utility package identified on the system or
   a shell process PATH would rightly be considered insane. What people do is use
   symlinks and a small number of entries in the PATH.
   So why not use the same technique inside Emacs?


   My next step will be to investigate this idea and ideally come up with code
   that automatically handle the auto-loading and
   integrates with PEL but with anything else, perhaps an independent
   package that anybody would be able to use.  Hopefully, that will be possible.
