Feature Overview
================

:See also: `Showing Information about Emacs Major Mode and its PEL Support`_
:See also: `⅀ Indentation PDF`_

Under Emacs, the indentation mechanism used by a programming language is
controlled by the major mode for this programming language.  The major mode
may use or completely replace the base indentation mechanisms provided by
Emacs.

The concept of indentation and the concept of hard tab width rendering are two
independent concepts, but they may be interrelated in some cases.

Emacs provides the ability to control the visual rendered width of a hard-tab
character (ASCII HT, binary value of 0x09) that may be inserted in text when
Emacs inserts hard tabs to replace a specified number of consecutive spaces to
the left of text when Emacs **indent-tabs-mode** (a minor mode) is active.

About Tab Width and Indentation
-------------------------------

Historically, the number of columns corresponding to a tab stop was 8.
Emacs controls the visual rendering width of hard tab via the **tab-width**
customizable user-option variable. That has a default value of 8, similar to
what was historically used.

The tab-width does **not** identify the indentation width;
it simply identifies the number of columns of each tab stop.

For example:

- with a tab-width of 8, the tab stops are located at column
  8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, etc ...
- with a tab-width of 4, the tab stops are located at column
  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, etc ...

In a major mode where the indent-tabs-mode is active and the tab-width is
set to 4, Emacs would use a hard tab character for the first 4 columns.
If the first non-whitespace character is supposed to be located at column 6,
as imposed by the indentation rules active for the mode,
then Emacs would use a hard-tab followed by 2 spaces then followed by that
character.  In this case the indentation text would be using a mix of hard-tab
characters and spaces.

Also note that under Emacs the ``<TAB>`` key in most major modes
does **not** mean inserting a hard-tab or its equivalent in space characters.
The key requests Emacs to perform the indentation of the current line.
Pressing the ``<TAB>`` key *anywhere* on the line will adjust the indentation
of that line.
If the indentation is already correct according to the rules, then nothing
happens, if the line is not indented properly according to the rules the Emacs
major mode code adjusts the indentation appropriately.

The ``<TAB>`` key is normally bound to the **indent-for-tab-command** or
something similar for the above purpose. Of course you can change it.  You can
also use other commands to insert hard tab characters rigidly but that's for
purposes other than code indentation.

About Indentation Schemes - Use hard tab or not?
------------------------------------------------

Back in the 1980's where a personal computer could be a `Apple-II`_, a
`Commodore-64`_, a `Heathkit H89`_ a `TRS-80`_ or some other machine with 64K of
system RAM or less and floppy disks used for storage, file space was a scarce resource.
It also was even if you were lucky enough to work with a `PDP-11`_ or even a
`VAX`_.

In those days, using hard tabs matching the indentation width made sense.
But with the normal physical screen width of 80 columns people soon wanted to
be able to use a narrower indentation width and the push for using spaces for
indentation and the push for being able to render hard tabs to less than 8
columns became more pressing.

People advocating the use of hard-tabs for indentation and matching the
indentation width saw it as a way to reduce file size.  Others saw it as a
non-consistent rendering problem since nobody was able to guarantee that all
printers would all print the code the same way: have drivers that could
interpret the printing of a hard tab to line up on 4 column tab-stops.

With computer with vast amount of system and storage memory, the use of spaces
for indentation became prevalent.  The guideline of most programming languages and
projects recommend using spaces for indentation.  Most but not all.

Others are pushing for a strategy using hard tab for indentation and spaces
for alignment.

That strategy is indeed a very good compromise and used by Go and the Linux
kernel C code development.

Not only it is space efficient but using hard tabs for indentation (all
indentation) allows someone to change the rendering of hard-tabs to widen or
narrow the rendering of the code shown on screen.  That allows several people
to be able to properly see the code; people with impaired vision often have
problem correctly interpreting code that use a 2-column indentation width
strategy.  And the use of that strategy is gaining in popularity for the newer
programming languages.

Considering that software development is often a team-activity and that living
software gets maintained over its entire lifetime (or should be), it's
important that all people working on the code can see it properly.

Where Emacs and PEL helps
-------------------------


Selecting Indentation Scheme for a Major Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PEL explicitly supports a large and growing number of programming language
major modes where it provides a set of customizable user-option variables that
identify the indentation scheme to use for new created files for the
corresponding programming language.

Here's a sample of some of the available PEL customizable user-options.

=================== ================================= =======================
Major Mode          Indentation Width Control         Tab Width Control
=================== ================================= =======================
c-mode              pel-c-indent-width                pel-c-tab-width
c++-mode            pel-c++-indent-width              pel-c++-tab-width
d-mode              pel-d-indent-width                pel-d-tab-width
erlang-mode         pel-erlang-indent-width           pel-erlang-tab-width
elixir-mode         pel-elixir-indent-width           pel-elixir-tab-width
python-mode         pel-python-indent-width           pel-python-tab-width
=================== ================================= =======================

For the modes where PEL identifies an indentation width and a tab width
control customizable user-option, PEL stores the value of the indentation
width control user-option to the buffer local variable that controls the
indentation for the major mode.  It does the same for the tab width control
user-option.

This ensures consistency when a programming language is supported by several
major modes (like a classical major mode and a tree-sitter aware major mode)
since several major modes may use different control variables.   PEL has the
logic that controls the settings, you do not have to worry and set the
appropriate mode variable; just set the PEL customizable user-option and PEL
will use it to set the variables that are needed for the major mode.

PEL also provides the **pel-show-indent** command,
bound to the ``<f11> <tab> ?`` key sequence,
that prints information about the customizable user-option variables
controlling the indentation and the tab width for the current major mode.

That command uses specialized logic for some of the major modes that PEL
supports, but not all of them.  The command is able to handle a large number
of major modes, even some that are not explicitly supported by PEL yet.

Here's a screenshot showing the report printed by **pel-show-indent** on Emacs
C source code files.

Adapting to Files' Indentation Scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Ref: `dtrt-indent in ⅀ Indentation PDF`_

The indentation and tab width control user options provide by PEL and the
major mode functions constitute the the indentation configuration scheme for
the major mode; what is used when creating a new file.  Your configuration
corresponds to your way of writing indentation in your files.

But you might want to edit *foreign* files; files that have been created by
others and that may use a different indentation scheme: a different indentation
width, and possibly a different convention in the use of hard tabs for
indentation.

When editing *foreign* files, it is best to activate the `dtrt-indent-mode`_ by
setting **pel-use-dtrt-indent** on.  With this activated, PEL ensures that the
`dtrt-indent-mode`_  global minor mode is active.  When a non-empty file is
opened, `dtrt-indent-mode`_ scans the content of the file, analyzes its
content to determine if the indentation control and hard tab use must be
modified. If it is necessary the mode overwrites the relevant mode local
buffer variables to automatically adjust the indentation behaviour to what is
already being used in the file.

The **pel-show-indent** command will show the modified value of these
variables.


Showing Indentation Scheme used by Current Buffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PEL provides the **pel-show-indent** command which displays information about
the indentation and hard tab width control for the current major mode inside a
information help buffer.  That command is bound to the ``<f11> <TAB> ?`` key
sequence.


The buffer lists the customizable user-options controlling the behaviour of
indentation for the major mode and the management of hard tab.  Each
user-option listed is a button that you can use to get more information about
it and gain access to the customization buffer where you can change the value
of the variable for this Emacs session or permanently.

For some major modes, PEL provides specialized information and describes
whether you could use a hard-tab based indentation scheme for this major mode,
allowing you to modify the rendered width of the indentation as you can in Go
buffers, and how to do it.

For example, in Gleam, where the indentation is normally made of 2 space
characters, you could:

- set **gleam-ts-indent-offset** to 2 (that's the default)
- set **pel-gleam-tab-width** to 2,
- set **pel-gleam-use-tabs** to t (on)

The text of the help buffer also instructs you to set
**pel-gleam-tie-indent-to-tab-width** to use-predef-vars.
Do that:

- press on the variable link to open help about it,
- select customize from that help buffer,
- set the customized value to use-predef-vars,
- save (either for the current session or permanently)
- close and reopen the file to use the new customization.

For Gleam buffer, the Gleam formatter is executed when you
the buffer is saved.  The Gleam formatter

Upon entering the Gleam buffer all indentation will be using space characters.
You can see it by using the **whitespace-mode**.

Mark the entire buffer with ``M-x mark-whole-buffer`` (or its key binding
``C-x h``) and execute ``M-x tabify`` (or its PEL key binding:
``<f11> t w TAB``).

After that all indentation should be implemented with hard tabs, one hard-tab
per level.  You have just changed the file content here by replacing spaces
with hard tabs.

At this point you can use the **pel-set-tab-width** command to change the
tab-width and the indentation control variables to use the same new value and
adjust the way the indentation renders on the screen.

Here's an example of this technique used on a Gleam buffer with a screen shot
taken after each step.

= ====================== ==================================================
. Screenshot             Description
= ====================== ==================================================
. `Step 1`_              At the beginning.  Hard tabs are used, tab-width is
                         equal to gleam-ts-indent-offset: they are both set to
                         2 as can be seen in the ``*pel-indent-info*`` buffer
                         on the left-hand side window.

. `Step 2`_              This shows the Gleam buffer with the
                         ``whitespace-mode`` minor mode turned on: each space
                         character is rendered as a period.  This is a
                         screenshot taken with Emacs running in a terminal
                         mode, so the period is rendered in red.  From this you
                         can see that each indentation level is using 2 space
                         characters.

. `Step 3`_              This shows the result after tabifying the entire buffer, we can see that
                         each indentation step was replaced by a single tab.
                         We're still using the same setup of 2 columns for
                         indentation and tab-width.
. `Step 4`_              This show of the screen looks after executing the
                         **pel-set-tab-width** command (bound to ``<f11> <tab>
                         w``) to select 6.  The command changes tab-width and
                         the variables identified by
                         pel-tab-width-control-variables
                         which, for Gleam is gleam-ts-indent-offset with a
                         offset of 0.  The effect of this change is that the
                         indentation now uses a level of 6 columns and that
                         still corresponds to a hard-tab, so the buffer content
                         does not change but the rendering  is wider.

. `Step 5`_              Once you deactivate the ``whitespace-mode`` you get a
                         more conventional rendering of the text.

                         From this point on you can use the
                         **pel-set-tab-width** command
                         to change the indentation width from 2 to 8; the
                         change does not affect the file content.

                         You can work with files this way and modify the
                         rendering of indentation as you see fit.

. Before submitting      At the end, before
                         submitting the file back to a repo that expect a
                         2-space indentation scheme, you can use
                         **pel-set-tab-width** to set the width to 2, abd
                         either untabify the buffer or use the gleam formatter
                         to replace the tabs to space characters.
