;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This provides undo and redo functions that are aware of the `undo-tree-mode'
;; and behave like their undo-tree-mode equivalent when the `undo-tree-mode' is
;; active or behave like the standard Emacs undo when undo-tree-mode is not
;; used.
;;
;; Having these functions simplify the management of undo-tree-mode when we need
;; to change the undo and redo key bindings.
;;
;; Note that we load `undo-tree' right away.  That's done because pel-undo is only
;; loaded when pel-use-undo-tree is t so when the undo-tree package is required.
;; However since we don't want to cause error if it is not present, the require
;; statement is written to not cause error and the functions are used only if
;; it is available.
