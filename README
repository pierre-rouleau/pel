The PEL package provides:

- Pre-canned configuration of several useful Emacs packages
  that loads quickly and which is controlled by Emacs customization
  system.
  This help getting going with Emacs without having to know
  the art of writing Emacs init.el file.
- The configuration is made to load quickly, making extensive
  use of auto-loading and deferred loading is used everywhere.
- The selection of package and features is done via PEL customization
  variables.
- Allows dynamic control of several packages with commands.
  For example, PEL support both auto-complete and company, providing
  commands to activate one mode in a buffer and another mode inside
  another or all other buffers directly from command execution and
  key strokes.
- Key bindings using function key prefixes (F2, F6, F11 and F12)
  provide access to many features and help learn what's available.
- The which-key package is used and activated by default, allowing
  you to see what's available easily.  F11 is the main prefix key
  and all prefixes have a meaningful name that starts with the
  'pel:' prefix.  F2 and F6 are used as global shortcut prefix keys,
  and F12 as a mode-sensitive shortcut prefix key.
- Most standard Emacs keys are left untouched.
- Documentation in the form of PDF file on several Emacs topics.
  Each table provides an overview, command descriptions, related
  key bindings  and links to related on-line documents.  The
  tables have extensive markup with colours for standard Emacs,
  external package, and PEL-provided command and key bindings.

PEL relies on Emacs customization system.  PEL activates third party
packages through customization, by setting a corresponding ``pel-use-...``
variable to t. Once a feature is activated through customization,
PEL also provides extra key bindings and in some cases allow dynamic
activation and de-activation of external packages.

PEL code is written in several files.  The pel.el file holds ``pel-init``
which initializes PEL, controls auto-loading of all supported packages
and builds the key bindings.  There are several other PEL files that
are used by that.  But they can also be used independently.  So if you
do not want to use PEL key bindings, you can just use some of the PEL
modules and provide you own bindings in your own Emacs init file.

This is an early version of PEL.  It will grow with time, incorporating
more Emacs packages to support more editing tasks.

To use the PEL auto-loading of packages and key bindings, put the
following code inside your Emacs ``init.el`` file:

.. code:: elisp

      (require 'pel)
      (pel-init)

To start PEL interactively, you can also type::

     M-x pel-init
