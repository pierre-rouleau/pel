;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines functions that prompt the user.
;;
;; The file defines the following functions:
;;
;; - `pel-y-n-e-or-l-p'
;; - `pel-select-from'
;;   - `pel--prompt-for'
;;
;;
;; The `pel-y-n-e-or-l-p' function is a minor modification of the Emacs'
;; y-or-n-p.  It has the ability to type "e" or "E" as an answer to
;; identify an edit-replacement action and "l" or "L" to request searching
;; a library file. It also modified the return type so it can return one of
;; 4 outcomes: yes, no, edit or findlib.
;;
;; The `pel-select-from' function provides a selection of choices to select from,
;; providing a quick interactive selection of choices.


;;; Code:

(defvar pel-prompt-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map "y" 'yes)
    (define-key map "Y" 'yes)
    (define-key map "n" 'no)
    (define-key map "N" 'no)
    (define-key map "e" 'edit)
    (define-key map "E" 'edit)
    (define-key map "l" 'findlib)
    (define-key map "L" 'findlib)
    (define-key map "\C-g" 'no)
    (define-key map "\C-]" 'no)
    (define-key map "\e" 'no)
    (define-key map [escape] 'no)
    map)
  "Keymap of responses to PEL prompts.
The \"bindings\" in this map are not commands; they are answers.
The valid answers include `yes', `no', `edit' and `findlib'.

This keymap is used by `pel-y-n-e-or-l-p'")


;;-pel-autoload
(defun pel-y-n-e-or-l-p (prompt)
  "Ask user a \"y, n or e\" question.
Return:
- 'yes     if the answer is \"y\",
- 'no      if it is \"n\",
- 'edit    if it is \"e\", or
- 'findlib if it is \"!\".
PROMPT is the string to display to ask the question.
It should end in a space;
`pel-y-n-e-or-l-p' adds \"(y, n, e or l) \" to it.

No confirmation of the answer is requested; a single character is
enough.
