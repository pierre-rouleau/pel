;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides rigid indentation support.  It is meant to be used in
;; files where the super useful automatic indentation of the function
;; `indent-for-tab-command' is used (and assigned to the tab key).
;;
;; The force rigid indentation is needed in several scenarios.  It's not that
;; useful for edit Lisp source code but is useful for other modes such as C
;; and other curly bracket programming languages as well as indentation
;; sensitive programming languages like Python.
;;
;; 3 commands are provided:
;;
;; - Function `pel-indent-lines' and `pel-unindent-lines' rigidly indent and
;;   un-indent the region by a specified number of indentation levels which
;;   defaults to 1.
;; - Function `pel-indent-rigidly' allows interactive indentation by 1
;;   character at a time or indentation level at a time.
;;
;; The number of columns used for the indentation level used by the functions
;; `pel-indent-lines' and 'pel-unindent-lines' is returned by the function
;; `pel-indent-level-colums'.
;;
;; The function `pel-indent-lines' and `pel-unindent-lines' handle hard tabs
;; properly according to the currently active `indent-tabs-mode'.
;;
;; - When hard tabs are not permitted (i.e. `indent-tabs-mode' is nil), the
;;   function replace all hard tabs in the indentation by the appropriate
;;   number of space characters.  The functions do not replace hard tabs that
;;   are somewhere else on the line (e.g. inside a code string).
;; - When hard tabs are permitted (i.e. `indent-tabs-mode' is t), the
;;   functions tabify the line or region marked.

;; TODO: enhance pel-indent-level-columns to better consider various types of
;; files for various programming and markup languages.
