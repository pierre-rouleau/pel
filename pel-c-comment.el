;;; Commentary:
;;
;; When commenting several lines of C code `comment-dwim' comments each line
;; independently. It does not create a single multi-line comment.
;;
;; The command `pel-c-comment-dwim' behaves like `comment-dwim' in every way
;; except when a region spanning more than one line is marked.  In that case,
;; the behaviour of the command depends on the value of the
;; `pel-c-multiline-comments' user-option:
;;
;;  - if nil:  behave like `comment-dwim'
;;  - if set to 1: create a multi-line comment with the 1 star format.
;;  - if set to 2: create a multi-line comment with the 2 star format.
;;
;; These 2 formats look like the following:
;;
;; - 1-star   /* One star
;;             * continuation
;;             * comment.
;;             */
;;
;; - 2-stars  /* Two stars
;;            ** continuation
;;            ** comment.
;;            */
;;
;; The `pel-c-comment-dwim' is meant to be used as a replacement for
;; `comment-dwim' in C buffers.
;;
