# Description
# -----------
#
# Launches emacs graphics mode in a detached process from the shell.
# Pass all specified command line options to the process.
# Identify the current working directory.
# Sets a PEL environment variable to identify the graphics mode:
#   this is only required for Emacs 27+ using the early-init.el and
#   independent customization files for terminal and graphics mode,
#   but does not hurt when older versions of Emacs are used.

# NOTE:
# On some shells, the export statement will set the environment
# variable in the *parent* shell instead of the sub-shell.
# That is the case for the latest version of Bash.
# For those, instead of an export statement, use the following line:
#
# PEL_EMACS_IN_GRAPHICS=1 emacs --chdir=$(pwd) "$@" 2>/dev/null &


# To activate this script
# -----------------------
#
# Copy it into a directory that is on the PATH of your shell.
# This is often the ~/bin directory.
#
# You may have to restart you session.  On some Linux distributions, Debian
# for example, if the ~/bin directory exists, the ~/.profile adds that
# directory to your shell PATH as long as the ~/.bash_profile does not exists.
# If the ~/.bash_profile exists make sure that the $(HOME)/bin directory is
# put at the beginning of your PATH.


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dependencies
# ------------
#
# The emacs command line program.  Under Linux this launches the graphics
# based mode of Emacs.
