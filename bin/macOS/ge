# Description
# -----------
#
# This launches the macOS graphics-based Emacs from a shell with all specified
# command line arguments.
#
# It also:
# - set the current working directory,
# - set a PEL environment variable to identify the graphics mode:
#   this is only required for Emacs 27+ using the early-init.el and
#   independent customization files for terminal and graphics mode,
#   but does not hurt when older versions of Emacs are used.

# - Launching Emacs from a shell also provides Emacs access to the shell's environment.
#
#
# Pass to emacs:
#   - --chdir to the current working directory so we open the same files
#     as what is specified on the command line. If we don't do that the GUI
#     based Emacs might use a different directory (I saw that it uses the home
#     directory) and if you specify files that are not in that directory they
#     will not be opened, another file file open which will most likely be
#     in an empty buffer (if the file does not exists in the home directory).
#   - All script command line arguments
#
# Note: The current Emacs for macOS graphical dumps an error when it starts.
#       This is annoying; it's noise on the shell.
#       Just mask it by dumping it in the bit bucket.
#
# Emacs 27+ support:
#    - To allow Emacs early-init.el code to distinguish whether Emacs is
#      running in terminal mode or in graphics mode.  When running
#           early-init.el Emacs does not know and the function
#           display-graphic-p does not work at that moment.  The only way I
#           have found is to use an environment variable.  So the following
#           code sets one up: PEL_EMACS_IN_GRAPHICS
