PEL Library NEWS         -*- org -*-

This file uses Org mode. Some useful (default) key-bindings:
 - Use "C-c C-n"/"C-c C-p" to jump to next/prev heading
 - Use "<tab>" to expand/collapse nodes
 - Use "<backtab>" to cycle visibility of all nodes
 - Use "C-c C-o" to open links

* First Version: 0.1.0
- This is the very first version of PEL, the Pragmatic Environment Library.

  - As described in [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#overview][PEL manual overview]] PEL is a hybrid package.
    It is:
    - a [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pdf-document-tables][collection of PDF]] files that document Emacs key bindings that covers
      standard Emacs key-bindings but also the key bindings provided by PEL and
      the external packages PEL uses.
    - an Emacs key binding documentation project
      (see [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pel-key-bindings][Key Bindings Documentation]]),
    - a collection of [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#id26][PEL convenience features]]  which:

      - are implemented in several mostly independent files,
      - have key bindings mostly using the function keys to provide
        key map trees that do not interfere with standard Emacs key bindings,
      - provide access to several other external Emacs packages (see [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#credits][Credits]])
        but via [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pel-customization][PEL Customization]] to selectively configure, enable and activate
        these features.
        - This conforms to the [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pel-customization][Emacs easy customization]] system and reduces your
          need to write custom Emacs Lisp configuration code.
  - PEL is distributed via the [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel][PEL Github repository]] and provides a Makefile to
    automate the compilation and a large part of the installation of PEL and its
    dependencies.
  - PEL is not yet distributed via sites like MELPA but
    [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#how-to-install-pel][PEL's installation instructions]] should alleviate this problem.
