PEL Library NEWS         -*- org -*-

This file uses Org mode. Some useful (default) key-bindings:
 - Use "C-c C-n"/"C-c C-p" to jump to next/prev heading
 - Use "<tab>" to expand/collapse nodes
 - Use "<backtab>" to cycle visibility of all nodes
 - Use "C-c C-o" to open links

* Version: 0.1.1
- new features:
  - rst support: added commands for text emphasis (bold, italic, literal, interpreted).
  - modified keymap: draw is now ``<f11> D``.
  - added support and documentation for diff/ediff (with keymaps ``<f11> d`` and ``<f11> e``.
  - Added support for Magit and Monky and ``<f11> v`` keymap for (D)VCS.
  - Added ``pel-end-of-line`` which helps move before trailing spaces.
  - Documentation: documented autoave & backup
  - Documentation: described limitations in the dual-stage autoloading.
- fixes:
  - navigation: fixed autoloading
* First Version: 0.1.0
- This is the very first version of PEL, the Pragmatic Environment Library.

  - As described in [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#overview][PEL manual overview]] PEL is a hybrid package.
    It is:
    - a [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pdf-document-tables][collection of PDF]] files that document Emacs key bindings that covers
      standard Emacs key-bindings but also the key bindings provided by PEL and
      the external packages PEL uses.
    - an Emacs key binding documentation project
      (see [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pel-key-bindings][Key Bindings Documentation]]),
    - a collection of [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#id26][PEL convenience features]]  which:

      - are implemented in several mostly independent files,
      - have key bindings mostly using the function keys to provide
        key map trees that do not interfere with standard Emacs key bindings,
      - provide access to several other external Emacs packages (see [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#credits][Credits]])
        but via [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pel-customization][PEL Customization]] to selectively configure, enable and activate
        these features.
        - This conforms to the [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#pel-customization][Emacs easy customization]] system and reduces your
          need to write custom Emacs Lisp configuration code.
  - PEL is distributed via the [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel][PEL Github repository]] and provides a Makefile to
    automate the compilation and a large part of the installation of PEL and its
    dependencies.
  - PEL is not yet distributed via sites like MELPA but
    [[https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel/blob/master/doc/pel-manual.rst#how-to-install-pel][PEL's installation instructions]] should alleviate this problem.
* Version 0.2.0
- Lots of updates since version 0.1.0, too many to describe here.
  PEL is still in what I consider an early development phase.
  Although most base features are stable, there's still several rough edges,
  lots of packages and programming languages I want to support are not
  properly supported.

  - I changed the instructions for installations on a new computer.
  - Added lots of cross-reference links between the PDF sheets.
  - Implemented a tempo skeleton generic file header block generation, and
    specialized ones for C, Erlang and reStructuredText files.
  - Support for Erlang and C is mostly complete, but there are several packages
    not supported yet.
  - Added support for sessions, projectile, hiding comments, hiding docstrings.
  - Added ability to automatically download and install packages from some
    non-Elpa compliant web sites (but path of Github) like EmacsAttic and
    EmacsMirror.
  - Support for generation of images using PlantUML and Graphviz Dot directly
    from within Emacs.
  - Support for several ways to deals with keys: Hydras, key-chord and key-seq,
    avy and ace-link.
  - Support for voice dictation under macOS and AppleScript.
  - Support for auto-completion using either auto-complete or company.
  - Support for input completion with Help, Ivy, Ivy/Counsel as well as Ido.
  - Support for bookmark management with bm.
  - Support for virtual-regexp
  - Key bindings to quickly access the customization buffer of several
    customization groups.
  - and more...
