;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This only contains a function to change the behaviour of the Emacs Lisp
;; defun navigation functions like `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun'.
;;
;; By default these stop at what looks like a defun form located inside a
;; string.  But the behaviour is controlled by the
;; `open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' user option.
;;
;; This file provides the command function
;; `pel-toggle-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start' to toggle the user option and
;; the behaviour of the navigation functions.

;; Credits:  Thanks to Andreas RÃ¶hler to mention the Standard Emacs variable
;;           `open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start'! That allowed me to
;;           replace a large amount of code with a simple toggle command and
;;           that handles the problem I had with checkdoc as well!
