;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides the following PEL-specific facilities:
;;
;; Setup for Dual Customization Environment : terminal(TTY) / graphics
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; - The ability to setup Emacs to support two independents environments: one
;;   for Emacs running in terminal (TTY) mode and another for Emacs running in
;;   graphics mode.  Each of them have their own customization file, their
;;   own set of Elpa directories to store the external Elpa-compliant
;;   packages.  This  allows taking advantage of the strengths of the
;;   terminal-based and graphics-based Emacs by customizing each environment
;;   with the packages that are used in each.
;;
;;   - The command `pel-setup-dual-environment' sets up the required files
;;     inside the `user-emacs-directory' if they are not already present.
;;     This must be done once.
;;
;; This is quite useful on OS, like macOS, where the graphics Emacs is
;; noticeably slower than its terminal counterpart.
;;
;;
;; Dynamic control to switch to a fast-startup operation mode
;; ----------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This provides the ability to reduce the Emacs initialization startup time.
;; Depending on what is used the speedup can be quite noticeable.
;;
;; For example, I have achieved a emacs-startup-time of about 0.15 seconds on
;; Emacs 26.3 running in terminal mode on macOS 2014 4 GHz Intel Core i7
;; computer with 240 installed external packages!
;;
;; This dynamic control of fast-startup also supports the dual
;; terminal-mode/graphics-mode environments.  When these are used, both
;; environments are switched together regardless of whether the switch was
;; requested by the command running inside Emacs in terminal or graphics mode.
;;
;; When running multiple Emacs processes on a computer, switching to
;; fast-startup or back to normal-startup mode from one Emacs instance does
;; not affect the other instances because files are not deleted.
;;
;; PEL uses the built-in Emacs package management provided by the package.el
;; builtin library.  The fast-startup operation mode improves startup speed
;; and does not prevent using package.el features to explicitly install
;; packages in the current environment.  However, these packages will not be
;; known to PEL.  In fast-startup mode PEL disables its internal automatic
;; package management facilities and does not download, install or remove
;; packages based on modification of the customization.
;;
;; The strategy is to reduce the length of Emacs `load-path' to a minimum.
;; This can therefore be used in conjunction of the Emacs 27+
;; `package-quickstart' feature to reduce Emacs startup time further.
;;
;; The length of `load-path' increases each time a new Elpa-compliant package
;; is installed by the package.el Emacs package manager.  These packages
;; consists of Emacs Lisp files stored inside a sub-directory of the Emacs
;; "elpa" directory, which is often located at "~/.emacs.d/elpa".  Each
;; package is inside a directory with a name that identifies the package and
;; its version.  Something like "ace-link-20210121.923" for the version
;; 20210121.923 of the ace-link package.
;;
;; The package directories hold the package Emacs Lisp (.el) files, as well as
;; the package specification structure stored inside a Emacs Lisp file named
;; after the package with the suffix "-pkg".  For example the package
;; specification file for the ace-link package described above would be the
;; following file: "~/.emacs.d/elpa/ace-link-20210121.923/ace-link-pkg.el".
;;
;; That file contains the data package-spec `cl-defstruct'-defined data
;; structure.  Something like this:
;;
;;    ;;; -*- no-byte-compile: t -*-
;;    (define-package
;;      "ace-link"
;;      "20210121.923"
;;      "Quickly follow links"
;;      '((avy "0.4.0"))
;;      :commit "e1b1c91b280d85fce2194fea861a9ae29e8b03dd"
;;      :authors '(("Oleh Krehel" . "ohwoeowho@gmail.com"))
;;      :maintainer '("Oleh Krehel" . "ohwoeowho@gmail.com")
;;      :keywords '("convenience" "links" "avy")
;;      :url "https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link")
;;
;; A large number of Emacs packages, like ace-link, store all their files
;; inside one directory; they have no sub-directories.  I call those "one-level
;; packages" in opposition of the other Emacs Lisp packages that use
;; sub-directories to store other files.  From what I have seen so far most
;; Emacs external packages use only one directory but not all.
;;
;; Emacs Lisp, a Lisp-2, has only one namespace for variables and one
;; namespace for functions.  Code in *all* packages, whether they're built-in
;; Emacs or external must all share these namespaces (and some other).  Most
;; package file names, if not all, reflect their package name and differ from
;; each other.  The functions and variable names in them must all be unique
;; otherwise they risk clashing with each other.
;;
;; Because the file names of all package have a unique name it becomes
;; possible to place them all inside the same directory (a bundle) and place
;; that unique directory inside Emacs `load-path', therefore eliminating
;; relatively slow Emacs startup processing that iterates through each
;; directory in its `load-path'.
;;
;; This can be done for the "one-level packages" but not the others, as their
;; code often relies on the relative position of their sub-directories.
;; Fortunately, as said previously, a large majority of Emacs external
;; packages are "one-level packages"; they use one or several Emacs Lisp files
;; all stored inside one directory.
;;
;; At startup Emacs package.el logic prepares Emacs files loading and checks
;; for the presence of the dependencies of packages.  The package.el logic
;; populates the `package-alist' variable with package symbol name and its
;; corresponding package spec.  This information is later used to determine
;; the presence of a package, its dependencies, and the directory where its
;; Emacs Lisp source code and byte-compiled files are located.
;;
;; Normally "one-level packages", like all other packages have an entry inside
;; the `package-alist' and their package spec identifies their corresponding
;; directory.
;;
;; The code here re-organizes the location of the external packages, storing
;; the code of "one-level packages" inside one directory (the "pel-bundle"
;; package directory) and leaving the other packages inside their original
;; locations.  The code also creates a pel-bundle-package.el and a
;; pel-bundle-autoloads.el file stored inside the pel-bundle directory
;; creating a Elpa-compliant pel-bundle package that includes all files of
;; one-level packages.
;;
;; Special code must be run by init.el or early-init.el to prevent the
;; package.el code from attempting to download the packages again.  The
;; required code is described inside the following files:
;;
;; - example/init/init.el and
;; - example/init/early-init.el
;;
;; The PEL installation instructions require you to install init.el and
;; early-init.el files that contain the code of these files.
;;
;; To provide ability to quickly switch from a normal setup to a fast-startup
;; setup and back, PEL uses a symlink to point to one of two Elpa directories
;; inside the `user-emacs-directory'.  Assuming that `user-emacs-directory' is
;; "~/.emacs.d", these directories are:
;;
;; - "~/.emacs.d/elpa-complete" : The original "~/.emacs.d/elpa" directory
;;                                renamed (or duplicated) by `pel-setup-fast'.
;;
;; - "~/.emacs.d/elpa-reduced" : Created by `pel-setup-fast'.  Holds all
;;                               multi-directory packages; the ones that are
;;                               not "one-level packages".  It also contains
;;                               the "pel-bundle-yyyymmdd-hhmm" directory; the
;;                               PEL bundle of all single-directory (the
;;                               one-level) packages.
;;
;; The PEL bundle is created each time the command `pel-setup-fast' is
;; executed to prepare Emacs for a fast startup.  Again, assuming that
;; `user-emacs-directory' is "~/.emacs.d" the PEL bundle directory is:
;;
;; - "~/.emacs.d/elpa-reduced/pel-bundle-yyymmdd-hhmm": Simulates a fictitious
;;                               Elpa-compliant pel-bundle package.  The
;;                               directory holds symlinks to the .el and .elc
;;                               files of all one-level packages that it
;;                               replaces.  It is created by `pel-setup-fast'
;;                               with the name tail set to its creation date.
;;                               It also holds the 2 important package
;;                               required files that are also created by the
;;                               function `pel-setup-fast':
;;                               - pel-bundle-autoloads.el
;;                               - pel-bundle-pkg.el
;;
;; PEL also converts the original elpa directory into a symbolic link that
;; points to either the following directories:
;;
;; - elpa-complete (in normal startup mode),
;; - elpa-reduced  (in fast-startup mode).
;;
;; When the dual terminal(TTY)/graphics customization support is used, PEL
;; uses one set of symlink and Elpa directories per environment: it
;; creates the following extra symlinks and directories for Emacs independent
;; graphics mode:
;;
;; - elpa-graphics symlink that points to one of the following directories:
;; - elpa-complete-graphics (used in normal mode for the independent graphics
;;   mode),
;; - elpa-reduced-graphics (used in fast startup mode for the independent
;;   graphics mode).
;;
;; *************
;; **IMPORTANT**
;; *************
;;
;; Again, for all of this to work properly you must instrument your init.el
;; and, if you use it, your early-init.el.  See the code sample examples
;; inside the following files:
;;
;; - example/init/init.el and
;; - example/init/early-init.el
;;
;; The code in pel-setup, specifically the function
;; `pel--update-emacs-user-file' (in pel-setup-base.el) and its callers edit
;; the init.el and early-init.el: they set the value of defcustom forms which
;; control the Emacs package.el behaviour at startup.

;; Support for dual environments
;; -----------------------------
;;
;; PEL supports a dual environment where the terminal/TTY mode uses one
;; customization file and a set of package directories and the graphics mode
;; use another, independent customization file and package directories.
;;
;; By default this mode is not activated.  The user can activate it by
;; executing the `pel-setup-dual-environment' command.  That function creates
;; all the necessary files and directories.
;; - It also updates the init.el and the early-init.el (in Emacs 27 and later)
;;    by setting the `pel-init-support-dual-environment-p' constant to t,
;;    allowing logic in those initialization files to force Emacs to use the
;;    graphic specific environment when Emacs is running in graphics mode.
;; - It also updates the `pel-support-dual-environment' user-option in both
;;   customization files.
;;
;; Later when Emacs starts, the code inside pel_keys.el executed by `pel-init'
;; schedule the execution of `pel-setup-check-dual-environment' to check if
;; everything is consistent, tries to fix the issues and report remaining
;; issues to the user in case of inconsistencies.  This operation is delayed a
;; little to ensure it does not slow the startup.

;; - Execute `pel-setup-dual-environment' to create all necessary files and
