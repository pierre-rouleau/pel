By default the function opens the local PDF file unless the
OPEN-GITHUB-PAGE-P is specified, in which case it opens the GitHub
hosted raw PDF file.  However, if the user-option variable
`pel-flip-help-pdf-arg' is set, it's the other way around: the
GitHub remote file is opened by default."

  ;; For some reason I don't yet understand, customizing
  ;; `org-refile-targets' before an Org file is opened shows
  ;; an error in the value and does not allow modifying the user-option, even
  ;; if the org.el is loaded.  So prevent execution until an org file is opened.
