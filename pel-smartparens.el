;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This provides specialized commands for moving across blocks with the
;; guarantee that point will not stop at symbols.  These allow controlling the
;; behaviour of other smartparens commands with `sp-navigate-consider-symbols'
;; while ensuring the behaviour of those commands is stable.
